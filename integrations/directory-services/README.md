# Directory Services

Engine extends beyond IoT control/monitoring when integrated with one of several enterprise directory service options. Directory service integration enables the Engine Staff API, which allows apps to offer experiences such as room searching/booking, user directory searching and calendar event information/interactions.

Data from directory services can be combined with IoT and/or location services data to add meaningful context to user interactions within a space. The result can be used to trigger an event in the space in real time or stored for retrospective analytics.

The preferred directory service is Microsoft Office 365 via Graph API. Other options are Microsoft Exchange \(via EWS\) and IBM Domino \(via Domino Access Service\).

# Interfaces

_Interfaces_ are web pages that present the user with controls for the System. Interfaces developed for ACAEngine generally use [Angular](https://angular.io/) to bind front-end web page elements to back-end Logic functions and values. A Systemâ€™s Logic will take the Settings defined for that system and use it to control \(visual\) elements on the interface. Interfaces are generally modular and usually connect to a one system at a time.

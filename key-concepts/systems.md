# Systems

A s_ystem_ is a collection of [devices](devices.md) along with [settings](settings.md) and basic metadata \(name, description etc\). They provide the main logical building blocks within ACAEngine deployments.

Systems often represent physical spaces \(such as a meeting room\) but can also represent such things as a digital signage endpoint or a non-physical system with information based inputs and outputs.

# Users

Engine usually integrates with an external directory system \(such as Active Directory\) for authentication.

The Users Section lists all users who have signed in, their level of access and a History \(log\) of the Systems which were accessed \(controlled from an Interface or viewed in Backoffice\).

## Permissions

When first logging on, a user will have no permissions assigned and will be denied access to Backoffice. A System Administrator should then look up the User from the list in the Userâ€™s Section of Backoffice and set their permissions:

* Tech Support: Have access to view Backoffice and all objects but cannot create or edit Systems and Devices.
* System Admin: Full write access to all objects

* **Software only** built on the modern web.
* **Open source** continuously improved and backed by a full-time team of developers.
* **Extensible** able to run stand-alone, or integrated into staff, building or third party apps.
* **Vendor agnostic** designed to bridge multiple disparate systems.
* **Scale-able** from rooms, to buildings, to precincts.
* **Distributed** multi-node replication for live backup and fail-over.
* **Secure** audit-able interaction with the physical environment and encrypted device communication.

The platform handles the low level device communication, system management and connectivity with user interfaces so that you can focus on how these combine to create intuitive, modern, connected environments.

Designed to run within your on-prem environment or private cloud the entire stack is open to ensure the privacy of your organisation and users is respected.

Deployments running today integrate tens of thousands of devices and services into unique experiences designed to improve health and happiness for staff and tenants.

There are no restrictions on what can be built, but here are some examples of [what's possible](https://acaprojects.com/#spotlight).

# Overview



## What is it?

_ACAEngine_ is a platform for creating digital experiences for physical environments. It connects devices, hardware systems and third-party software to provide an API for the built environment.

* **Software only** built on the modern web
* **Open source** continuously improved and backed by a full-time team of developers
* **Extensible** able to run stand-alone, or integrated into staff, building or third party apps
* **Vendor agnostic** designed to bridge multiple disparate systems
* **Scalable** from rooms, to buildings, to precincts
* **Distributed** multi-node replication for live backup and fail-over
* **Secure** audit-able interaction with the physical environment and encrypted device communication
* **Insightful** provides analytics for physical systems

The platform handles the low level device communication, system management and connection with user interfaces so that you can focus on how these combine to create intuitive, modern, connected environments.
